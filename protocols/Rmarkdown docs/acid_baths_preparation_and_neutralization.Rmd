### Goal

  This protocol details preparation and neutralization of acid baths used for cleaning glassware.

### Supplies/Equipment Needed  

* HCl
* Phenolphthalein Indicator
* Ethanol
* NaOH
* Plastic tub for HCl
* Stir Plate
* Magnetic Stir Bar
* pH Strips
* Fume Hood

### Acid Bath Preparation

  Prepare 10% HCl by filling H2O up to the first dashed line on the Acid bath tubs and then slowly add HCl into tub until liquid reaches the second dashed line.

### Acid Bath Neutralization

  1. Add 10-20 drops phenolphthalein indicator per 10L 10% HCl.  (to make indicator: 4 g Phenolphthalein into 400 mL 100% ethanol).  

  2. Place acid bath tub onto stir plate inside fume hood.  

  3. Add a stir plate magnet and turn stir plate on med/high (DONâ€™T TURN ON THE HEAT).   

  4. Add NaOH or other strong base (can be waste or old base) to acid bath, stirring, until bath turns a light pink color (at pH 8.4).   

  5. Make sure Acid Bath is between pH 7-9 before pouring down drain.  If you overshoot pH 9, you can use HCl to bring the pH back down (can use other old acid bath 10% HCL to bring pH back down).   

  6. Once acid bath is faint pink dump it down the drain and scrub clean the tubs.
