### Goal

This protocol details the steps to process images of leaf samples measured for HPLC analysis and applicable for SLA.

### Supplies/Equipment Needed  

* ImageJ software

### ImageJ
```
1. Open image: file - open

2. Set scale:
    a. Click line:
        i.  Draw line from one side of the image to the other
    b. Analyze - set scale: 
        i.  For inner line of boat 0.0028m, set to global, okay

3. Identify leaf
    a. Image - adjust - color threshold 
        i.  Unselect black background
        ii. play with hue, saturation, brightness: leaf should be red
    b. close color threshold

4. Calculate area of leaf
    a. Analyze - analyze particles:
        i.    Set lower size limit - Infinity
        ii.   Show: outlines
        iii.  Display results
        iv.   Exclude on edges
        v.    Include holes
        vi.   Summarize
5. Add area to excel
        i.  Make sure outlines are of leaf/needle.
