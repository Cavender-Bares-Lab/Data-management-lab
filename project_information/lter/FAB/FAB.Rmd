### FAB - Forest and Biodiversity

This long term experiment tests the consequences of tree biodiversity for forest growth, benefits to animals, protection from disease and pests, and soil fertility.

###### The Fabulous Trees
*  Written by Maria Park
```
Let us paint a picture:
A garden of sorts
Full of trees

The trees live in communities
Orderly, as it appears
Planted one meter apart from next-door neighbors

But some trees grow fast
Inching into the neighbor’s allotted space
The trees cast shadow

The neighbors still get along?

Aboveground:
Some trees don’t
Mind the shade
For the sun makes them wither and fade

Belowground:
The trees are cycling!
Water and nutrients
Differently?

In-between:
Decomposers
Associate with
Partner trees

Compete, they will
For they must survive

But living next to a tree
Different from oneself creates
Opportunity for reciprocity

Each tree plays a role in the community
We, humans, are trying to learn

How do they
Coexist
```
