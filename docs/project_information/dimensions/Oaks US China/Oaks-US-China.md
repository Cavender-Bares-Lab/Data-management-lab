### Common Garden Overview
In Fall 2018, bur oak acorns were collected in Minnesota, Illinois, and Oklahoma and were then planted at Indiana DNR nursery in Vallonia prior to the ground freezing. Prior to planting, acorns were cleaned and soaked overnight to facilitate germination. The following summer, the tops of the stems were cut off because of limited space.

In Fall 2019, bur oak acorns were collected in Minnesota, Illinois, and Oklahoma. These were cleaned and soaked overnight and shipped to Indiana DNR nursery in Vallonia and were planted in the late winter of 2020.

In Fall 2020, bur oak acorns were collected in Minnesota, Illinois, and Oklahoma and were planted in the late fall in Indiana DNR nursery.

The 2018 and 2019 cohorts were surveyed in the fall of 2020. A small sample of seedlings were measured for spectra.

In March 2021, the 2018 and 2019 cohorts were lifted and wrapped in a cold room. The seedlings were inventoried and grouped for each garden site.
