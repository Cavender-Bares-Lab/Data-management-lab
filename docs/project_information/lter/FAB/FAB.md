### FAB - Forest and Biodiversity

This long term experiment tests the consequences of tree biodiversity for forest growth, benefits to animals, protection from disease and pests, and soil fertility. Treatments are by species richness, functional and phylogenetic diversity.

###### The Fabulous Trees

- Written by Maria Park

    Let us paint a picture:
    A garden of sorts
    Full of trees

    The trees live in communities
    Orderly, as it appears
    Planted one meter apart from next-door neighbors

    But some trees grow fast
    Inching into the neighbor’s allotted space
    The trees cast shadow

    The neighbors still get along?

    Aboveground:
    Some trees don’t
    Mind the shade
    For the sun makes them wither and fade

    Belowground:
    The trees are cycling!
    Water and nutrients
    Differently?

    In-between:
    Decomposers
    Associate with
    Partner trees

    Compete, they will
    For they must survive

    But living next to a tree
    Different from oneself creates
    Opportunity for reciprocity

    Each tree plays a role in the community
    We, humans, are trying to learn

    How do they
    Coexist

#### FAB 1 - High Density
##### Background Information
- Planted in 2013 and 3 replantings from 2014-2016 with irrigation from 2013-2015.
- Trees planted 0.5 meters apart in 145 plots in species richness of 1, 2, 5, or 12.
- Plots 112 and 119 were treated with herbicide for poison ivy.
    - Herbicide spread to the experimental trees and killed many trees.
    - These plots are no longer active and were replaced with plots 146 and 147.

#### FAB 2 - Low Density
##### Background Information
- Field site was burned and then disked in 2015. All tree stumps were removed from field site.
- Trees were planted 1 meter apart. Bare root tree roots were trimmed to 10.25 inches in length and planted with dibble bar.
    - For 10x10 plots, known maternal lines were planted for species ACRU, BEPA, QUEL, QUMA, and QURU. The seeds were collected in Minnesota, and PRT nursery germinated and planted the seeds. 
- 148 10x10 plots were planted in spring 2016 in species richness of 1, 2, 4, 6, or 12.
- 41 20x20 plots were planted in spring 2017 in monocultures or all 12 species plots.
    - 3 20x20 plots for each species and 5 20x20 all species plots.
- Replanting from spring 2017-2020.
- In spring 2022, 11 20x20 plots were converted to 10x10 plots because of poor survival rates from the last replanting.
    - 9 of these 10x10 plots were kept as is and for the remaining 35 10x10 plots, the trees, if still alive, were pulled out and replanted with four oak species (QUAL, QUEL, QUMA, QURU).
- In 2016-2022, gophers were monitored and trapped.
- Full site irrigation in spring and summer of 2016-2022 with 2 Kifco T200L water reels.
