### FAB - Forest and Biodiversity

This long term experiment tests the consequences of tree biodiversity for forest growth, benefits to animals, protection from disease and pests, and soil fertility. Treatments are by species richness, functional and phylogenetic diversity.

###### The Fabulous Trees

-   Written by Maria Park

<!-- -->

    Let us paint a picture:
    A garden of sorts
    Full of trees

    The trees live in communities
    Orderly, as it appears
    Planted one meter apart from next-door neighbors

    But some trees grow fast
    Inching into the neighbor’s allotted space
    The trees cast shadow

    The neighbors still get along?

    Aboveground:
    Some trees don’t
    Mind the shade
    For the sun makes them wither and fade

    Belowground:
    The trees are cycling!
    Water and nutrients
    Differently?

    In-between:
    Decomposers
    Associate with
    Partner trees

    Compete, they will
    For they must survive

    But living next to a tree
    Different from oneself creates
    Opportunity for reciprocity

    Each tree plays a role in the community
    We, humans, are trying to learn

    How do they
    Coexist
