# Oak Wilt Project Information

The goal of the Oak Wilt project is to accurately detect oak wilt using remote sensing at multiple scales. The project is ongoing and is funded by multiple grants.

##### Grand Challenges

- Proposal: [Protection of biodiversity and ecosystems services through early detection of tree disease using hyperspectral remote sensing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c6Nv27WIEki9eaBbhoWkZwIch5fQmCmo/view?usp=sharing){:target="\_blank"}
- Greenhouse seedling project took place in 2017 and 2018.
    - In 2017, Quercus macrocarpa and Quercus ellispoisalis seedlings (<1 year old) were gifted from Dr. Chad Giblin. These were originally planted in ~2.5 x 2.5 inches pots, 3-4 inches deep pots. In March 2017, these seedlings were transplanted in to deep tree pots.
        - There were two rounds of oak wilt and bur oak blight inoculations. One set were inoculated at the end of May 2017 and the second set were inoculated in July 2017.
        - There were 4 treatments: control, drought, oak wilt, bur oak blight (bur oak only)
    - In 2018, se

##### MITPPC

-   Proposal: [Accurate detection and integrated treatment of oak wilt (Ceratocystis fagacearum) in Minnesota](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ICaRB7J1mkWSLtR7Ga6hXiAlgFPiiRaa/view?usp=sharing){:target="\_blank"}

Note: The scientific name of oak wilt has since been renamed from Ceratocystis fagacearum to Bretziella fagacearum.
