### Oak Wilt

The goal of the Oak Wilt project is to accurately detect oak wilt using
remote sensing at multiple scales. The project is ongoing and is funded
by multiple grants.

##### Grand Challenges

-   Proposal: [Protection of biodiversity and ecosystems services
    through early detection of tree disease using hyperspectral remote
    sensing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c6Nv27WIEki9eaBbhoWkZwIch5fQmCmo/view?usp=sharing)

##### MITPPC

-   Proposal: [Accurate detection and integrated treatment of oak wilt
    (Ceratocystis fagacearum) in
    Minnesota](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ICaRB7J1mkWSLtR7Ga6hXiAlgFPiiRaa/view?usp=sharing)

Note: The scientific name of oak wilt has since been renamed from
Ceratocystis fagacearum to Bretziella fagacearum.

###### Cedar Creek Proposals

-   Oak Wilt Survey proposal: [Oak Wilt Survey at Cedar
    Creek](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wbM3HO-71f692EcY1NuM8qAlgpC9pqFa/view?usp=sharing)  
-   Sapling experiment proposal:[Field detection of oak wilt (Bretziella
    fagacearum) in experimentally inoculated saplings of Quercus
    ellipsoidalis and Q.
    rubra.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CxZXH8rO_kmqmU5LR7xJyPS5xICWe60M/view?usp=sharing)
