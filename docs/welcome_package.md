#### Lab Etiquette

Please be mindful that our lab is a shared space with each other and
with other labs. Try your best to keep your space clean and organized.

Your data and analysis are both valuable to yourself and the whole lab.
Please well document storage of your data and work through “data
management”. More details below.

Please use the equipment

to reserve equipment use. This is especially important during field
season.

#### Lab Safety

-   **Always label containers/beakers even if it only contains
    water.**  
-   **Always keep chemicals enclosed in containers or beakers (covered
    with parafilm or aluminum foil).**
-   **Please don’t cause any fires or explosions.**  
-   The lab should **ALWAYS** be audit ready.

To enter the lab, you are required to take several training courses
prior to access. You must enroll and take the following courses:
[Introduction to Research
Safety](https://training.umn.edu/courses/10466), [Chemical
Safety](https://training.umn.edu/courses/10463), and [Chemical Waste
Management](https://training.umn.edu/courses/10462).

##### Hazardous Waste Management

-   **Always keep liquid hazardous waste in secondary containment with
    label “Hazardous waste.**  
-   **Make sure your hazardous waste chemicals are compatible with each
    other.**  
-   **Always keep your hazardous waste bottles labeled and enclosed.**  
-   **Please do not use Nalgene bottles as hazardous waste bottles.
    These are expensive. Use an empty (rinsed out) chemical bottle.**  
-   **Please dispose sharps in sharps waste container. DO NOT leave it
    out.**

### Purchasing

#### UMarket

Ideally, if you can, complete your purchases on
[Umarket](https://www.myu.umn.edu/psp/psprd/EMPLOYEE/EMPL/h/?tab=DEFAULT#/tab_UM_FS_PURCHASING).

-   Contact umarket \[at\] umn.edu to get access to Umarket as a
    **purchaser**.
-   When you are ready for checkout:
    -   Click on “Checkout”
    -   Under “General” section and “codes”. Choose “non-capitol”, “lab
        and medical supplies”, and “laboratory supplies”.
    -   Fill out the description (brief title).
    -   Be detailed in your justification and include the chartstring.
        Copy the justification and chartstring info as you will need it
        later. Click “save changes”.
    -   Then click on “assign cart”. Paste your justification and
        chartstring and assign the cart to Tori Lafky (lafky004).
    -   Your items, by default, will be shipped to lab 240. If you would
        like to ship it to Cargill or Cedar Creek, please specify in the
        justification section.

##### Notes:

-   Do not “favorite” items. Save catalog numbers through an excel
    sheet. Favoriting items will lock in the price and will cause
    problems/delays later if prices change.
-   Order well ahead of time. Depending on the item and supply, it may
    take several weeks for shipment.

#### ChromeRiver

If your item is not on Umarket, you may purchase with your personal
credit card and get reimbursed through
[ChromeRiver](https://www.myu.umn.edu/psp/psprd/EMPLOYEE/EMPL/s/WEBLIB_IS_AW.ISCRIPT1.FieldFormula.IScript_AssemblePage?AWGroupID=UM_TRAVELING_ON_U_BUSINESS_DEV&AWPageID=UM_TRAVELING_ON_U_BUSINESS_DEV&AWObjName=UM_TRAVELING_ON_U_BUS_LPG).
For instructions on submission, there are instructions and videos on the
main page under “Job Aids”.

#### Purchase Orders

If you’re making a large purchase (purchase order is required when
item(s) are &gt;$2k) and/or a purchase order is an option, fill out a
form
[here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScz4NuifjoXXULS01ub-0urzSKaAVH_3qJcFSr9kxFBUpoUvQ/viewform).

If you have questions or none of these options are applicable, please
contact Cathleen for purchasing help.
