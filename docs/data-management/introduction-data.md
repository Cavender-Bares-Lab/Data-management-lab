## Data Storage and Management

To help keep the lab’s data and documentation of data organized and up-to-date, please follow the lab’s structure detailed below on data storage and organization. This will greatly help any future lab work!

### University Shared Drive

Data should be stored in the lab’s university shared drive. Documentation of your data is categorized by project. Please include both raw and processed data and any relevant scripts for the processed data. Always include README text files.  
    * If your data is too large to store in the university shared drive, please refer to [MSI Tier 2 storage](https://cavender-bares-lab.github.io/Data-management-lab/welcome_package/#msi) for details. Documentation on location is key.
    * For shared drive and google drive information, refer to the [Welcome Package](https://cavender-bares-lab.github.io/Data-management-lab/welcome_package/#shared-drive-access) for details.

#### Data
Submit your data information to the webpage manager.  
Include the following information:
    * Associated project(s)
    * Storage location of your data in the University shared drive along with your metadata (detailed below).

    * When was this data collected?  
    * How was the data collected? Reference protocols when necessary.  
    * Why was the data collected?  
    * What type of analyses will this data be used for? Reference to

###### Spectra
In addition to the README text file, all spectra should specifically have the following documentation:
    * For **leaf level** and/or **canopy level** measurements using either the PSR+ or the SVC, **ALWAYS** include information following this [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rMFBWMnhqw8VJURLzc7I6j651w4iFfbX/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117278050553426340443&rtpof=true&sd=true).

        * Location
        * Sensor type
        * Resolution
        * Geographic Coordinate System
