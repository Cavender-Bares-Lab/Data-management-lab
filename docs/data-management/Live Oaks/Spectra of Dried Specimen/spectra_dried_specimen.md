### Files

There are 3 files created on Fulcrum App that document metadata and
storage location of the spectra of dried live oaks taken in spring 2021.
The live oaks were collected in several different locations (from
previous projects) including throughout South United States, Central and
South America. The README.txt has column definitions. The fulcrum\_id in
file 1 links to the fulcrum\_parent\_id in file 2.
