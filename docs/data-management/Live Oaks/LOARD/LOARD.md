### Introduction

Documentation of important data files that match with spectra taken in
spring 2021. Not all individuals in each file were successfully matched.
The live oaks were collected in several different locations (from a live
oak phylogeography project) including throughout South United States,
Central and South America. There are many copies of one excel file in
the Live Oaks folder. The matched files are not limited to the files
mentioned below. The most recent files were chosen. Also, there are some
variations of the sample ID between different types of data
e.g. MX-MB3030 and MXMB3030.

### Spectra

##### Files

There are 3 files created on Fulcrum App that document metadata and
storage location of the spectra of dried live oaks taken in spring 2021.
The README.txt has column definitions. The fulcrum\_id in file 1 links
to the fulcrum\_parent\_id in file 2. The files are linked from the
shared google drive and are also stored in the University shared drive
