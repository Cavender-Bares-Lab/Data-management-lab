### Why this webpage?

Created, remove, and update documentation is essential for any project
project. This webpage was created using
[Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to satisfy the documentation
requirements for the lab.

This webpage does not not replaceable data storage requirements (e.g.,
group/cavender, google drive, or local drives), but it allows users to
respond questions like:

-   Where is the data?
-   How the data was collected?
-   What protocol I need to be follow?
-   Among many others â€¦

If you need to create, remove, or update documentation please follow the
bellows guide, or ask to the lab-technician for help.
