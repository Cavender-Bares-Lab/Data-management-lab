### Goals

Spectralon Care and Handling Guidelines

### General Care

Care should be taken to prevent contaminants such as finger oils from contacting the materialâ€™s surface. Wear clean gloves when handling Spectralon.

### Cleaning Instructions

If the material is lightly soiled, it may be air brushed with a jet of clean dry air or nitrogen. DO NOT use Freon. For heavier soil, the material can be cleaned by sanding under running distilled water with 220-240 grit wet or dry emery cloth until surface is totally hydrophobic (water beads and runs off immediately). Blow dry with clean air or nitrogen or allow to air dry.

In order to preserve the integrity of the frame it is suggested that the PTFE panel be removed prior to wet sanding.

Better results are produced using a flat surface sanding block during sanding
operations.
