### Goal

This protocol is for the surface sterilization of leaves for fungal
endophytes analyses using ethanol and bleach.

### Materials

-   Sterile Water.
-   70% Ethanol.
-   70% Bleach.
-   5 beakers (1 for each of the 5 treatments).
-   Forceps.
-   This should be performed in a BSL1 or BSL2/laminar flow hood to keep
    the leaves in a sterile environment.

### Steps

    1. First wash: Rinse with sterile water to remove dusts.
    2. Second wash: Place the plant sample in 70% ethanol for 1 minute.
    3. Third wash: Place the plant sample in Bleach (50% or higher) for 2 minutes.
    4. Fourth wash: Place the plant sample in 70% ethanol for 1 minute.
    5. Fifth wash: Rinse the plant sample off in sterile water.
    6. Leaves are now surface sterilized and can be placed into sterile 50mL tubes,
    then into -80 storage.

### Hazardous Waste Handling

-   Ethanol and bleach wastes can be poured down the sink with large
    amounts of water.

-   Any plant samples that are not used should be bagged and stored in
    freezer for further use or autoclaved and disposed of in the
    garbage.
