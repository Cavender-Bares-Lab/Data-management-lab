### Goal

This protocol is for the sterilization of surfaces using Ethanol and
Bleach.

### Materials

-   Sterile Water.
-   70% Ethanol.
-   70% Bleach.
-   5 beakers (1 for each of the 5 treatments).
-   Forceps.
-   This should be performed in a BSL1 or BSL2/laminar flow hood to keep
    the leaves in a sterile environment.

### Steps

1.  First wash: Rinse with sterile water to remove dusts.
2.  Second wash: Place the plant sample in 70% ethanol for 1 minute.
3.  Third wash: Place the plant sample in Bleach (50% or higher) for 2
    minutes.
4.  Fourth wash: Place the plant sample in 70% ethanol for 1 minute.
5.  Fifth wash: Rinse the plant sample off in sterile water.
6.  Leaves are now surface sterilized and can be placed into sterile
    50mL tubes, then into -80 storage.
