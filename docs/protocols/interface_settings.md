### Goals
Documents multiple examples of settings for Hansatech fluorometer. Settings are dependent on your project and goals.

#### Mid-day (oleiodes project)

1. Actinic light, equivalent to ambient light: 
    1.  Set value between 0 and 50 (steps from 0 to 3000 micromoles m-2s-1)ðŸ¡ªprobably keep at 50, check readout
    2.  Need 10 sec of actinic light for measurement

2. Pulse: saturating light to leaf:
    1.  Check peak fluorescence by pulse from 0 to 100
    2.  Choose the saturating pulse, without torturing plant with high light (at beginning of plateau value)

3. Width of pulse: length of pulse
    1. .7 is what Jose uses, check that additional pulse exposure doesnâ€™t change fluorescence adjust to maximize

#### Yield (oleoides)

In general,there is an initial high yield light exposure, then 10 sec of actinic light, then another saturating pulse
    
1. Gain: 50 (check glossary)

2. Mod: 2 (modulation, check manual if need to adjust)

3. Log: 1 (1= log data, 0=no logging)

4. FVFM: ##,##,##
    1. 2.5 duration of element
    2. 60 intensity of saturating pulse (adjust as needed)
    3. .7 width

5. ACT: 43 actinic

6. WAIT: 10 (seconds of waiting)

7. ePS2: 
    1. 2.5 duration of element
    2. 60 pulse
