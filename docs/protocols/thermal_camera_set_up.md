### Detailed Steps

1. Attach lens and cords to thermal camera and Lenovo laptop. Turn on the camera.

2. Open Flir IP config application â€“this allows ResearchIR to quickly identify the camera for connection.

3. Open ResearchIR and connect to the camera. Name of camera should be A6701sc.

4. If the camera view is not seen in ResearchIR, let the camera warm up for several minutes. If the camera view is still not seen, restart ResearchIR and reopen. This often takes several minutes.

5. Note: The camera view will often freeze or will be out of view. Wait a couple seconds for the view to return.
