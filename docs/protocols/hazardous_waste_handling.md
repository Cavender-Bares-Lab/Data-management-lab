### Goal

This protocol is to guide the proper handling of hazardous waste.

### Cases

-   Ethanol and bleach wastes can be poured down the sink with large
    amounts of water.

-   Any plant samples that are not used should be bagged and stored in
    freezer for further use or autoclaved and disposed of in the
    garbage.
