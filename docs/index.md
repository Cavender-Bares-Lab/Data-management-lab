# Documentation for Cavender-Bares Lab

## Welcome

This webpage serves as a site for documentation associated with
[Cavender-Bares Lab](https://cbs.umn.edu/cavender-bares-lab/home){:target="\_blank"}. 

The goal is to have a centralized site where lab members can easily access documentation i.e. lab and project information, protocols, data documentation, and lab products.

For new lab members, please refer to the [Welcome Package](https://cavender-bares-lab.github.io/Data-management-lab/welcome_package/){:target="\_blank"}. For exiting lab members, please refer to the [Leaving Package](https://cavender-bares-lab.github.io/Data-management-lab/leaving_package/){:target="\_blank"}.

**Please note**: In scenarios where documentation overlap in different sections, the simplest way to find it is through the search bar. If you cannot find something and would like it added to the webpage, please contact, Cathleen, the current manager of the webpage.
