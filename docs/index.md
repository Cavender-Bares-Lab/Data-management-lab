# Documentation for Cavender-Bares Lab

## Welcome

This webpage serve as a site for documentation associated with
[Cavender-Bares Lab](https://cbs.umn.edu/cavender-bares-lab/home). 

The goal is to have a centralized site where lab members can easily access documentation i.e. lab and project information, protocols, data documentation, and lab products.

Please note: in scenarios where documentation overlap in different sections, the simplest way to find it is through the search bar. If you cannot find something in particular and would like it added to the webpage, please contact, Cathleen, the current manager of the webpage.
