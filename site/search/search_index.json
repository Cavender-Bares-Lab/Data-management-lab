Ankom Protocol for the Hobbie Lab The Ankom Fiber Analyzer utilizes a series of extractions to determine the fiber content of a plant sample. Each of the extractions should be done in the order of NDF (Neutral Detergent Fiber), ADF (Acid Detergent Fiber), then ADL (Acid Determined Lignin). The NDF solution is just soapy water. During NDF, the fraction that is washed off contains soluble cell contents like carbohydrates, lipids, pectin, starch, soluble proteins and non-protein nitrogen. The fraction that is left in the bag contains hemicellulose, proteins bound to the cell walls, cellulose, lignin, and recalcitrant materials. ADF solution is a 1.00 Normal sulfuric acid and detergent solution. During ADF, hemicellulose and bound proteins are washed off. The fraction left behind contains cellulose, lignin, and recalcitrant materials. The ADL solution is ultra nasty 72% sulfuric acid. During ADL, cellulose is washed off leaving only lignin and recalcitrant materials. All calculations can be found in the Template spreadsheet in the Ankom Data folder on the computer in the Hobbie Lab. Supplies All Ankom solutions can be ordered from Ankom: Ankom Technology 140 Turk Hill Park Fairport, NY 14450 phone: 716-425-3940 fax: 716-425-3941 www.ankom.com Updated 2/28/2019 Neutral Detergent solution - catalog # FND20 - 20 L for $95, 20L for $113. Acid Detergent 5x solution - catalog # FAD20 - 1 L (dilutes to 5 L) for $80, 20L for $75, 20L for $93. 72% Sulfuric acid - catalog # FSA72 - 1 L for $34. Filter bags - catalog # F57 \u2013 200 for $240, 200 for $252. Steps for sample preparation Grind samples using a 1 mm screen and dry. Label bags with special Ankom marker or permanent Sharpie. Tare Ankom bag and record weight. Weigh out .5 g (\u00b1 0.05 g) of sample and record weight. Include a blank bag in each run (each batch of 24) for a blank bag correction. Seal the bag closed within 0.5 cm from the open edge using the heat sealer. Be sure to seal the blank bag too. Spread sample uniformly inside the filter bag by shaking and lightly flicking the bag to eliminate clumping. A maximum of 24 bags may be place in the bag suspender. All nine trays are used regardless of the number of bags being processed. Place three bags per tray and then stack trays on center post with each level rotated 120 degrees. Each tray will sit in the notches of the tray below it. The weight is placed on top of the empty 9 th tray to keep the bag suspender submerged.","title":"Ankom Fiber Analyzer"},{"location":"protocols/ankom_fiber_analyzer/#goal","text":"This protocol serves as a guide to use the Ankom Fiber Analyzer.","title":"Goal"},{"location":"protocols/ankom_fiber_analyzer/#ankom-protocol-for-the-hobbie-lab","text":"The Ankom Fiber Analyzer utilizes a series of extractions to determine the fiber content of a plant sample.

Requirements Scanner Image J software Steps 1. Scanning Leaves Place leaf on front of envelope face down on scanner. The goal is to have leaf and label visible in photo. Make sure a clear ruler is also on the scanner and seen in the image. Enter scanning and camera wizard. Choose color picture and name the file something unique like the date and page number. Save as JPEG image in a folder. Scan photo. Open photo and look to see if it scanned appropriately. Return each leaf to its appropriate envelope. Place leaves in drying oven in back of room 230. 2. Image J Open program Image J. Select File open. Open scanned photo. Click on the line box to select draw line tool. Draw a line on the ruler of a certain length. (8 cm). Select Analyze: Set Scale. Enter 8 under known distance and unit of length cm, check global. Click ok. Select Process: Binary : Make Binary (or Process: Image: Make Binary). The poto will now appear in black and white. Select Analyze: Set measurements. Make sure area, perimeter, and Feret\u2019s diameter are checked. Choose ok. Click on the wand tool. Click on one of the leaves with wand tool. It should highlight the perimeter of the leaf in yellow. If a leaf is touching another leaf or a line it will trace around everything. You will need to use the eraser or draw tool to separate where it is touching. Also if image is split you will need to use draw tool to fill in leaf. Once the leaf is highlighted around the perimeter select Analyze: Measure. A new window will appear with the measurements. Copy these measurements into an excel spreadsheet with appropriate labels and save.","title":"Measuring leaf area"},{"location":"protocols/measuring_leaf_area/#goal","text":"The goal of this protocol is to standardize the measurements of leaf area using scanned leaves and Image J.","title":"Goal"},{"location":"protocols/measuring_leaf_area/#requirements","text":"Scanner Image J software","title":"Requirements"},{"location":"protocols/measuring_leaf_area/#steps","text":"","title":"Steps"},{"location":"protocols/measuring_leaf_area/#1-scanning-leaves","text":"Place leaf on front of envelope face down on scanner.
