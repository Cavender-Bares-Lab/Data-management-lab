### Files  
There are 3 files created on Fulcrum App that document metadata and storage location of the spectra of dried live oaks taken in spring 2021. The live oaks were collected in several different locations (from previous projects) including throughout South United States, Central and South America. The README.txt has column definitions. The fulcrum_id in file 1 links to the fulcrum_parent_id in file 2.
