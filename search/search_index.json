Numbers of acorns, trees and locations We are aiming to collect more than 160 acorns from each of 20 mother trees in each of four regions (Minnesota, Illinois and Oklahoma). For each region, we need 160 x 20 = 3,200 acorns. In each region, 20 trees should be selected from four or five different sites, such that seeds from an individual tree are unlikely to have the same father (>20 m apart). It is important to put acorns from one mother tree in an individual bag and label it by site and mother. At the location of each tree, please record the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude); google map coordinates are sufficient. Take photos of each tree, if possible. If you are in doubt about the identify of the tree, please send a pressed specimen from the tree for us to verify identification. How to collect acorns Acorn viability is greatest when mature acorns are collected directly from the tree. If they are freshly fallen, they will still be viable. If they have been on the ground a while, they are likely to be infested and rotting on the inside. Acorn storage Collect and store acorns, if possible, in very light weight plastic bags. These should be thin enough to allow the acorns to \u201cbreathe\u201d. Freezer bags tend to be too heavy. Paper is not recommended because it will allow acorns to dry out, and they are also likely to rip with moisture/condensation. Remove the caps of the acorns after collection to allow aeration and prevent rotting. Acorns can be stored in the refrigerator (~6oC) until you are ready to ship them. If you are storing them for several weeks or more before shipping them, it helps to put them in slightly damp sterile sand. Leaves for DNA extraction/Branch Specimens for Identification Please send one or more fresh, healthy leaves from each tree for DNA extraction in the JCB lab. These should be kept refrigerated until shipping. If you have time, you may also wish to send pressed specimens. To make a pressed specimen, snip a branch with 5-10 leaves (preferably a sunlit branch) and place it in between 2 or more sheets of newspaper (or other paper). Use a standard herbarium press or simply pile heavy books on top until the specimen is flattened and dry or can be bound to send. Sheets can be trimmed to be the size of standard printer paper (8 x 10\u201d). One specimen from each tree would be ideal, one specimen per site would be a good idea. Labeling system Each bag should contain acorns from only one mother tree. It should be labeled with the state, site name, species name and the tree number that you have assigned it. Specimens should be labeled with permanent marker using the same label. Shipping To FedEx acorns, check bill recipient on the FedEx form and enter account number 1081-3386-4. If you prefer we can email you a printable FedEx label, if you provide us with your address and the approximate weight of your box. Specimens can be sent via snail mail and we will reimburse costs.

Processing When acorns are received process as soon as possible. If acorns cannot be processed immediately, store in refrigerator. Soak acorns in water for several hours or overnight (maybe could use 5% bleach for this initial soak to kit surface fungi,bugs, I have done this with other seeds before). Be sure to keep acorns from different trees separated during this process. Only keep the acorns that sink. Throw away floating acorns or any with holes or visible damaged. Note: keep floating acorns if acorn production was low and as a result, collection was low. Set acorns out to dry overnight, then place them breathable plastic bags with sterile sand and coating of fungicide and insecticide (a coating of sand works fine, they don\u2019t need to be completely buried in sand). Label each bag with a code. I labelled with state-tree number and species. Q. rubra WI-1, etc. Keep track of all of the location information in a spreadsheet. Also count them at this point. If you are sending some to NY again, you want to divide them in half at this point and put in two separate bags (one for NY and one for MX). Place bags in a labelled cardboard box and put in the cold room. Before USDA inspection for exporting to MX they will need to be cleaned of all sand and chemicals and inspected again for fungi and insects. Fill out USDA export documents online.

Important Note At least 0.5 grams of sample is required for analysis. Ankom Protocol The Ankom Fiber Analyzer utilizes a series of extractions to determine the fiber content of a plant sample. Each of the extractions should be done in the order of NDF (Neutral Detergent Fiber), ADF (Acid Detergent Fiber), then ADL (Acid Determined Lignin). The NDF solution is just soapy water. During NDF, the fraction that is washed off contains soluble cell contents like carbohydrates, lipids, pectin, starch, soluble proteins and non-protein nitrogen. The fraction that is left in the bag contains hemicellulose, proteins bound to the cell walls, cellulose, lignin, and recalcitrant materials. ADF solution is a 1.00 Normal sulfuric acid and detergent solution. During ADF, hemicellulose and bound proteins are washed off. The fraction left behind contains cellulose, lignin, and recalcitrant materials. The ADL solution is ultra nasty 72% sulfuric acid. During ADL, cellulose is washed off leaving only lignin and recalcitrant materials. All calculations can be found in the Template spreadsheet in the protocols folder in the Cavender-Bares Lab University shared drive.

When processing 24 sample bags add 1800-1900 ml of ambient Neutral Detergent solution into the chamber. Be sure the valve on the left side of the machine is closed! If you're processing less than 24 samples, load the bag suspender from the bottom up and fill the chamber until the bags are covered. I found that 13 bags are covered by 1500 ml of solution. 2. Place bag suspender into the chamber. Turn Agitate and Heat ON and confirm that the bag suspender is agitating properly. Set the timer for 75 minutes. Close and seal the lid of the chamber. 3. Just before the 75 minutes is up, heat 1800 ml nanopure water to boiling in the electric tea kettle 4. After 75 minutes turn Agitate and Heat OFF, open the drain valve and exhaust the hot solution BEFORE opening the lid. Be aware, the solution will be around 100\u00b0 C. The neutral detergent can be dumped down the drain. WARNING: The solution in the vessel is under pressure. The valve should be opened first to remove pressure before the lid can be opened. Ensure that the exhaust hose is securely positioned for safe disposal of effluent. 5. After the solution has been exhausted, close the valve and open the lid. Pour in the 1800 ml of boiling water and just lower the lid but do now seal it. Agitate for 3-5 minutes, but do NOT Heat. Exhaust the rinse water down the sink. During the first rinse, heat 1800 ml of water for a second rinse. Rinse two more times for a total of 3 rinses. 6. Remove the filter bags and gently press out the excess water. Place them in the drying oven and dry completely. I dry them overnight at 65\u00b0 C. 7. Cool bags to room temperature and weigh all the bags. Record weights. 8. Move on to ADF extraction. NDF Calculations Note: blank bag correction (C) = blank bag wt. after extraction/blank bag tare wt. % washed off (soluble cell contents) = (((Tare wt. sample bag + sample wt.) - bag wt. after NDF) x 100)/sample wt. % left after NDF (hemicellulose, bound proteins, cellulose, lignin, recalcitrants) = ((bag wt. after NDF - (tare wt. sample bag x C NDF )) x 100)/sample wt. ADF Extraction 1. Dilute the 5x ADF solution to the desired volume for a run. Pour it into the chamber. Make sure the valve on the left side of the machine is closed! 1900 ml 1x ADF = 380 ml 5x ADF solution + 1520 ml nanopure water 1500 ml 1x ADF = 300 ml 5x ADF solution + 1200 ml nanopure water 2. Place the bags in the bag suspender and place it in the chamber. 3. Turn Agitate and Heat ON and confirm that the bag suspender is agitating properly. Set the timer for 60 minutes. Close and seal the lid of the chamber. 4. Just before the 60 minutes is up, heat 1800 ml nanopure water to boiling in the electric tea kettle. 5. After 60 minutes turn Agitate and Heat OFF, open the drain valve and exhaust the hot solution BEFORE opening the lid. Be aware, the solution will be around 100\u00b0 C. The acid detergent solution should be exhausted into a waste container. (The waste can later be neutralized and dumped down the drain.) WARNING: The solution in the vessel is under pressure. The valve should be opened first to remove pressure before the lid can be opened. Ensure that the exhaust hose is securely positioned for safe disposal of effluent. 6. After the solution has been exhausted, close the valve and open the lid. Pour in the 1800 ml of boiling water and just lower the lid but do now seal it. Agitate for 3-5 minutes, but do NOT Heat. Exhaust the rinse water down the sink. During the first rinse, heat 1800 ml of water for a second rinse. Rinse two more times for a total of 3 rinses. 7. Remove the filter bags and gently press out the excess water. Place them in the drying oven and dry completely. I dry them overnight at 65\u00b0 C. 8. Cool bags to room temperature in a desiccator and weigh all the bags. Record weights. 9. Move on to ADL extraction. ADF Calculations Note: blank bag correction (C) = blank bag wt. after extraction/blank bag tare wt. % washed off (hemicellulose and bound proteins) = (((bag wt after NDF - (tare wt sample bag x C NDF )) - (bag wt after ADF - (tare wt. sample bag x C ADF )) x 100)/sample wt. % left after ADF (cellulose, lignin, and recalcitrants) = ((bag wt. after ADF - (tare wt. sample bag x C ADF )) x 100)/sample wt. ADL Extraction 1. Place dry bags in a 2 L beaker and cover with 72% sulfuric acid (~300 ml to cover 48 bags). It is important that the bags are completely dry. If there is any water in the sample, the reaction of the water with the strong sulfuric acid will generate heat. The sample could char and you could lose sample. 2. Place a 1 L beaker inside the 2 L beaker to keep bags submerged. 3. Agitate bags at start and at 30-minute intervals for 3 hours. Do this by lifting the 1 L beaker up and down ~ 30 times. 4. Just before the 3 hours is up, heat 1000 ml nanopure water. 5. After 3 hours, pour off the sulfuric acid into a waste container and rinse with the boiling water. Rinse with boiling water until the pH is neutral. This takes about 6-7 rinses. I have been dumping my rinses down the drain. 6. Gently press out the excess water. Place them in the drying oven and dry completely. I dry them overnight at 65\u00b0 C. 7. Cool bags to room temperature in a desiccator and weigh all the bags. Record weights. (At this time you can ash your bags if you are concerned about sand, silica, etc. content.)

Information This excel/VBA program was written in Microsoft office Excel 2003, using Richard Grier\u2019s \u201cActiveX control\u201d for serial communications, downloaded from his website ( http://home.comcast.net/~hardandsoftware ) in October 2007. I modeled the interface using instructions from Rick Collard\u2019s article on interfacing excel with electronic balances which I downloaded from ( http://www.msc-lims.com/lims/diybalance.html ). Supplies/Equipment Needed Serial port to USB cable Sartorius Balance Computer/Laptop Instructions for installing. 1. You need a serial-port-to-USB cable. For sartorius balances this is part YCC01-USBM2 and it costs about $55. Install the driver software provided with the cable. This assigns one of your USB ports to handle this cable. Test the interface using Window's \"hyperterminal\" (start|program-files|accessories|communications|hyperterminal) making sure that the port settings match the balance output. Press the balance's \"print\" button to send weight to hyperterminal. Also make sure the balance is set to output data regardless of stability on receiving the \"print\" command. Once hyperterminal is working and the balance settings are all correct, go to the next step. 2. Download the XMCommCRC.ocx file that is the ActiveX control that you will add to excel. I don't think it matters where you put it. There are also three other files (*.dll, *.isr, *.isu) that I don't think are necessary, but they came with the download, so better put them in the same folder too with the .ocx file. 3. Download the conduct.verX.xls file and open it in excel, enabling the macros. 4. In excel, go to view|toolbars|control toolbox to open the \"control toolbox\". Click on the \"more controls\" button, usually at the bottom. Go to the bottom of this list and click on \"register custom control.\" This will open the browser which allows you to find where you stored the XMCommCRC.ocx file. Highlight this file and open it. That adds this control as another button on the toolbox, or in the pull down list for \"more controls\" when you next open the control toolbox. 5. Now, go to tools|macro|visual-basic-editor, to open the visual basic window. On the upper left, expand the \"forms\" directory and double-click on \"userform1.\" If it does not open, it will probably prompt you for additional *.ocx files (COMCTL32.ocx, MSComm32.ocx, for example). That means you have to repeat the \"register control\" process described in step 4 and add these files. If your computer doesn't have them already, I can send these two for you to load on. It may need other ones too (although not in my experience) that you might have to find somewhere and add on. 6. Once you can open the \"userform1\", if it shows a \"using checksum\" box then you are ready to go. If all you see are a grid of dots, then you need to add the MSComm control on the user form. Open the \"control toolbox\" again, and look for the MSComm button. If it is not there, go to tools|additional-controls, find it on the list and add it. Back on the control toolbox, click on the MSComm button once, move to the userform, and click again, and it adds the control (you will see the \"using checksum\" box). Return to the excel spreadsheet and save the program. It should be ready to go now. Good luck, every computer and excel version seems different. 6. To run the program, first go to the \"settings\" sheet and configure the port settings to match the usb-serial port and balance settings. Then change the elevation, latitude, and pipette displacement settings. The first pipette setting is the length of the pipette immersed in cm per gram of weight change as water is added to the balance. Measure this by filling your reservoir by \"x\" number of grams, and measuring the corresponding rise in water level in cm. The second pipette setting is the displacement weight change in grams per cm of pipette immersed. Measure this by noting the increase in grams as you dip the pipette \"x\" cm deeper in the reservoir. 7. Back on the \"results\" sheet, at the top, enter the time interval, hydraulic head (or kPa if desired), solution temperature, sample size for the running mean (usually 5), segment length in mm, and segment diameter in mm. Each conductivity measurement is based on three readings: an \"initial\" value which is the flow into or out of the stem with zero pressure gradient, a \"stem\" value which is the pressure-induced flow, and a \"final\" value which repeats the zero pressure measurement. The initial and final are averaged, and subtracted from the pressure-induced flow to give the net flow induced by the pressure. This is divided by the pressure gradient to give the conductivity, which is corrected to 20C from whatever temperature your solution is. To get the initial, stem, and final readings, hit the corresponding buttons. The program gives the individual flow rates, and a running mean. We usually wait until we get three or four running mean values that look consistent before stopping the program. To stop the program, hit \"ESCAPE.\" Choose the line number for the flow rate mean you wish to use, and it will be entered in the \"current values\" section. When the final reading is done, the conductivity is automatically calculated, and you are prompted for the line number for saving the data to the \"stored values\" section. Moving the data clears the current values. You can also calculate the conductivity at any time by pressing the \"kcalc\" button. 8. If you have a non-sartorius balance, you'll need to change a few lines of code based on what your balance uses for a software-induced \"print\" command, and how it outputs its weight through the serial cable. Sartorius uses ESC / P / CR / LF as its print command, and it outputs a string of 16 characters. I've noted most of these lines of code\u2014they are all in \"userform1\" and can be accessed by the visual basic editor from excel. Any modifications you wish to make in the data handling, etc., can be made in the \"module2\" section of the code in the \"sub Balance ()\" procedure.","title":"Balance Interface Program Instructions for Hydraulic Conductivity"},{"location":"protocols/balance_interface_program_interface_hydraulic_conductivity/#author-john-sperry","text":"","title":"Author: John Sperry"},{"location":"protocols/balance_interface_program_interface_hydraulic_conductivity/#goals","text":"Using the Excel VBA program \u201cconduct\u201d to measure conductivity with a Sartorius Balance.","title":"Goals"},{"location":"protocols/balance_interface_program_interface_hydraulic_conductivity/#information","text":"This excel/VBA program was written in Microsoft office Excel 2003, using Richard Grier\u2019s \u201cActiveX control\u201d for serial communications, downloaded from his website ( http://home.comcast.net/~hardandsoftware ) in October 2007.

Eddy; Updated: 6 November 2019 by Allison Gill Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) measured as non-purgeable organic carbon (NPOC) and Total Nitrogen. Often used in our lab to measure microbial biomass on non-fumigated and fumigated soil samples. Instrument Shimadzu TOC-VCSN Shimadzu TN unit Shimadzu autosampler (ASI) Shimadzu TOC-V software controller Owned by Jacques Finlay. Samples Water (no dilution, and Salt Extracts (3x dilution) Supplies Aluminum Foil Standard Stock Solution (Finlay lab fridge next to instrument) 2 M HCl 0.05 M HCl Nanopure water Volumetric pipets Volumetric flasks 23 mL glass Vials (number of samples plus 14 standards)~ Ultra High Purity air (Ustores p/n cx77020)~ Note: Supplies with ~ and other Shimdzu supplies (TOC catalyst, combustion tubes, O rings, etc, are supplied by Jacques Finlay as part of the per sample cost.) Procedure Sample Preparation The Shimadzu carousel can accommodate 93 total vials. Each run will require 14 vial spaces for standards (2 curves with seven points each). Vials are stored in the Hobbie Lab and should be acid washed and ashed between uses. 1) For HIGH SALT SAMPLES (0.5M K2SO4) **Please dilute your samples at least 4:1** to a total volume of 22 mL. This will make the catalyst and detectors last longer. This should be done manually. 2) Put 22 mL of sample in TOC vial. Add 100 uL 2 M HCl to each vial. Cover with aluminum foil and press down over top with thumb. 3) Store acidified samples in the refrigerator until you are ready to start your run (ideally that day). STANDARD PREPARATION Prepare standards using the stock solutions located in the Finlay Lab fridge near the Shimadzu. Make sure to use appropriate standard containers (most often for total N and DOC rather than DIC). 1. Dilute standard stock solutions to build curve containing seven concentrations, with target concentrations matching those listed in the DOC-TDN Standard Dilution Template. 2. Place TOC vial on a balance and zero mass. Add DOC stock solution to target mass according to the DOC-TDN Standard Dilution Template (Column G). Record mass in column I. Add TDN standard (goal amount in column H) and record mass of both standards in column J (do not zero balance between standard addition). Add nanopore water to a total mass of ~22 g and record in column J. Calculate the exact standard concentration as: (Mass stock*Stock Concentration)/Total Solution Mass. (Solution density =1g/mL, which allows the solutions to be prepared by mass rather than volume). 3. Prepare two replicate curves, recording exact masses and calculating concentrations for each. 4. Each standard vial can be analyzed twice. I usually place standards in positions 1-14 in the carousel and assign one set to be read at the start and after 1/3 of samples and the other to be read after 2/3 of samples and at the end. If you not running the full rack of samples, it may be fine to make one set of standards and run it at the beginning and end of the run. SAMPLE ANALYSES Machine Start-up: 1) Start air flow to TOC by opening main valve on gas tank. Check that 500 psi air remains in tank to complete a run. Do not run the analyzer below 500psi! 2) Power on TOC-L (button on front of machine). Ozone generator should turn on automatically. 3) Turn on Computer 4) Open TOC control to warm instrument a) Connect by clicking the lightning bolt, always using \u201csettings on PC\u201d b) Warm up should take 45min (TOC-L). 5) Pre-run checks: a) Open front panel on TOC machine b) Check Humidifier level- it should be within \u00bc\u201d of high mark. Fill with nanopure water if level is low. c) Acid (0.05M HCl) column inside machine should be full and bubbling d) Acid at the side of the machine (2M HCl) i) Volume above \u00bc, tube at the bottom of bottle e) NOTE: backpressure sometimes prevents acid addition. ENSURE THAT ACID ADDITION IS FUNCTIONING BY OBSERVING MOVEMENT OF ACID INTO THE MULTIPORT VALVE DURING SAMPLE. f) Dilution (square bottle next to machine) and rinse reservoir i) Fill with fresh nanopure ii) NOTE: backpressure sometimes prevents dilution. ENSURE THAT DILUTION IS FUNCTIONING BY OBSERVING MOVEMENT OF WATER INTO THE MULTIPORT VALVE DURING SAMPLE INTRODUCTION. g) Halogen scrubber \u2013 if there is more than a cm or so of discoloration, it is time to replace the scrubber. (if any doubt, replace the scrubber. It is relatively cheap, the detector is not) 6) Warm up check list a) Pressure Gauge inside instrument should be 200kpa; Mass flow for TC should be 125-130. Set the flow rate to ~210kpa for the TOC-L using the regulator on the gas tank. The meter is in the \u201cmonitor\u201d tab. b) Check back internal water reservoir for bubbling (there shouldn\u2019t be). Bubbling indicates overpressure of TN unit or too little water in back reservoir (add until it overflows into tube using a squirt bottle). c) TOC-L \u2013 TNM-1, O3 generator, and autosampler turn on with main button (onfront of machine) d) TN flow should be 0.4 \u2013 0.5 for TN 7) Sample setup (one option) a) Create new sample run: \u201cFile\u201d, \u201cNew\u201d, \u201cSample Run\u201d b) Connect to the analyzer, always using \u201csettings on PC\u201d c) Go to \u201cInsert\u201d and select \u201cSample\u201d to set up sample table i) Select previously stored method that will reference the specific calibration files you would like to use (use one with most recent date) ii) Insert samples or autogenerate samples iii) Insert standards at beginning, middle, and end of the run (each standard can be read 2 times, so read the same set for the beginning and middle, then a different set for the end) (1) Insert standard concentrations from the same protocol: \u201cinsert\u201d > \u201csample\u201d then hit \u201cnext\u201d until through the menu. iv) Run a rinse before low standard and after high standard each time (So you will be inserting 7 samples and 2 rinses). Rinses should be noted as vial position zero. v) Assign vial positions to each sample vi) Important: Run at least 4 blanks at the end of the run to flush the sample syringe. These may be draw from the Erlenmeyer flask (i.e. vial position zero) to save room on the autosampler rack. To do this, \u201cInsert\u201d > \u201cMultiple Samples\u201d. Check the rinse reservoir each day and refill with nanopore as needed. d) Save file with unique name in the appropriate \u201cData\u201d folder e) Load samples in carousel in appropriate vial positions 8) Wait for top right corner of the DOC program to say \u201cready\u201d 9) Run Samples a) Click on stoplight (connect if the stoplight isn\u2019t highlighted) b) Make sure vial positions are correct, edit if necessary 10) Save file then export as ASCII (detailed version) 11) Shutdown a) Automatic shutdown: i) select \u201cshut down instrument\u201d button on standby in sample setup ii) shut off gases once the unit turns itself off, or as soon as possible thereafter iii) NOTE: the automatic shutdown does not always work!! b) Manual shutdown: (i.e. \u201c keep running\u201c selected in sample setup) i) Click on standby icon to begin shutdown Let gas run for 20min ii) Machine will completely power down in 30min. Turn off gas at main valve 12) Files a) Your data i) It is possible to reanalyze sample runs at a later date if the appropriate files are saved ii) If there are data, method, or calibration files (i.e. all files associated with your run) that you wish to keep after you are through running your samples, please keep a copy either on a disk or in the \u201cShimadzu user files\u201d folder b) Your responsibilities i) Please update the log sheet as to the specifics of your run such as the number of samples run, budget numbers, analysis performed, et cetera. CALIBRATION AND METHODS FILES 1. Calibration a. Standard curves are stored in fridge #1 and may be used in multiple runs: i. Standards should bracket samples across no more than 1order of magnitude i.e. use various curves according to the expected sample concentration. ii. Always add standards to your own run as a check of calibration \u2013 best to run a set at the beginning, middle and end to adjust for any drift. 2. Method file \u2013 use one of the preset methods listed below for the TOC-L or most recent for the TOC-Vcsh. a. Water 160pp C 20ppm N b. Water 500ppm C 20ppm N c. Water 100ppm DIC d. Salt 160ppm C 20ppm N ***This is probably what you want to use ROUTINE MAINTENENCE 1) Change CO2 absorber and halogen scrubber 12 months, or as soon as discoloration begins. 2) Catalyst: a. Regenerate catalyst when repeatability declines using \u201cRegenerate catalyst \u201c command under \u201cMaintenance\u201d b. If performance does not improve, replace catalyst. After installing new catalyst, condition it using 10 DI samples (5inj/sample, 150\uf06dL/injection; use method \u201cNew column breakin.met\u201d) 3) Change membrane filter, o-rings, and manganese dioxide (TN) once per year 4) Check screw on bottom of injection syringe (with lockwasher between syringe and screw). Screw should be tight \u2013 if it\u2019s loose, tighten it up & watch it to ensure it does not fall off during the run 5) If syringe adjusted, use \u201csyringe zero point detect\u201d to reset syringe NOTES and TROUBLESHOOTING: 1) For manual injection, use vial zero 2) Peak shape usually not of concern. However, could indicate problems: a. Combustion tube b. Sample injection 3) No baseline return = contamination 4) Keep instrument door closed 5) Concentrated Stock standards should be remade every 6 months 6) Detection limits a. Regular sensitivity catalyst i. DOC = at least 0.5mg/l ii. TN = at least 0.1mg/l b. High sensitivity catalyst (a new machine system is necessary) i. DOC = 0.05mg/l ? ii. TN measurements CANNOT be made with this catalyst HIGH SALT SAMPLES (i.e. 0.5 M K2SO4 extracts) 1. Please dilute your samples at least 4:1 ! This will make the catalyst and detectors last longer. This should be done manually. 2. At the end of every overnight run: a. rinse sample line and valve lines (automatic) b. rinse injection port and syringe c. run 3 DI samples, using 5 injections per sample, 150 \u00b5L per injection 3. Catalyst/columns lasts about 700 samples, but has to be washed after 500-600 samples due to salt build-up, so it\u2019s best just to change out catalyst when salt build-up gets too great (after 500-600 samples). If samples are diluted, salt build up may not be an issue before catalyst change is necessary. 4. Acid wash combustion tube when changing catalyst\u2014it\u2019s good to have an extra tube on hand so that you don\u2019t have to wait to pack a new column. 4. Sometimes after salt build-up is high, pressure builds up and unseats the combustion tube, forcing it out of the O-ring seal. When this happens, the TOC reading is 0.000 due to leakage. CONSUMABLES 1) Air, UHP/zero grade, #cx77020 from Ustores, 2) Please inform Finlay if any other supplies (e.g. combustion catalyst) are running low METHODS OPTIONS: IC \u2013 sparge to the detector TC \u2013 everything to the detector TOC \u2013 by difference NPOC \u2013 Sample is acidified, sparge gas is vented, liquid is injected to detector. Risk is loss of volatile organics.","title":"Dissolved Organic Carbon and Total Nitrogen"},{"location":"protocols/dissolved_organic_carbon_and_total_nitrogen/#author-william-c-eddy-updated-6-november-2019-by-allison-gill","text":"Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) measured as non-purgeable organic carbon (NPOC) and Total Nitrogen.

Method is typically used for net mineralization. Ammonium Analysis The Salicylate Method is a variation of the well-known Phenate Method, but it has an advantage of being free from mercury salts and phenol. This method is most useful for low range ammonia nitrogen determinations. Ammonia compounds are initially combined with hypochlorite to formmonochloramine (1), which then reacts with salicylate to form 5-aminosalicylate (2). Oxidation of 5-aminosalicylate is carried out in the presence of a catalyst, nitroprusside or Fe(CN) 5 NO 2 \u2013 (also called nitroferricyanide), which results in the formation of indosalicylate, a blue-colored compound. The blue color is masked by the yellow color (from excess nitroprusside) causing a green-colored solution. The intensity of the color is directly proportional to the ammonia concentration in the sample. Nitrate + Nitrite Analyses Adapted from: Doane TA, Horwath WR (2003) Spectrophotometric determination of nitrate with a single reagent. Analytical Letters 36:2713-2722. Vanadium (III) in dilute acid solution reduces nitrate (NO 3 - ) to nitrite (NO 2 - ) and/or nitric oxide, both of which react with the sulfanilamide and N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine to produce color with an absorbance peak at 540 nm. Ammonium Reagents Sodium Salicylate solution In a 100 ml volumetric flask add: 6.8 g sodium salicylate (stored in analytical room) 5.0 g sodium citrate (stored in analytical room) 5.0 g sodium tartrate dibasic dehydrate (stored in analytical room) 25 mg Sodium nitroprusside (stored in desiccator in analytical room, weigh out on microbalance) -> Bring to volume with nanopure water. -> Store in refrigerator, lasts a week. -> Note: Make 100ml for every 192 samples. NaOH Solution In a 1000 ml volumetric flask add: 60 g sodium hydroxide (stored in analytical room) -> Bring to volume with nanopure water. -> Store in plastic. Bleach Solution Make fresh each day In a 100 ml volumetric flask add: 2 ml of household bleach (stored under sink of south side of lab) -> Bring to volume with NaOH Solution. -> Note: Make 100 ml for every 192 samples. Nitrate Reagents 1M HCl Per 1000 mL 82.5 ml concentrated HCl ( 12.1N \u2013 stored in acids cabinet ) in 1000 mL water. REMEMBER TO ALWAYS ADD ACID TO WATER -> Store in plastic. Vanadium Reagent Solution Make concentrated (150 ml total volume) for low ppm NO 3 - samples or dilute (300 ml total volume) for high ppm NO 3 samples. To a dark plastic reagent bottle add: 100 ml of 1M HCl 200 mg of sulfanilamide (stored in analytical room) 100 mg of N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (stored in desiccator in analytical room) In a separate 50 ml glass beaker add: 50 ml 1M HCl 400 mg of vanadium (III) chloride (stored in desiccator in analytical room) -> CAUTION: Work quickly because Cl3V powder will react with air! -> Wear protective face mask and follow standard lab safety (wear glasses, gloves, lab coat) when preparing vanadium chloride. Mix vanadium chloride and HCl by swirling in the beaker and transfer to 60 ml syringe outfitted with a 0.45\u03bc filter . Add vanadium chloride solution to the reagents in the dark plastic bottle by pushing vanadium chloride solution through the syringe. If making the dilute solution (for high ppm NO3 samples), add 150 ml of nanopure water. Note if low ppm samples (<2ppm NO3-), you can leave this water out to get more color development. Purge with nitrogen or helium. Nitrogen tank is located in the analytical room and outlet is currently piped to LICOR the incubator room. Unhook from LICOR (unhook connector located before the external regulator) before turning tank on. Insert tubing into connector and put outlet in reagent bottle. Bubble with nitrogen for several minutes and fill headspace with nitrogen. Store at -20oC in opaque bottle. Can be stored frozen for several months. Note: Make 125ml for every 192 samples. Standards 0-8ppm NH 4 -N, NO 3 -N 1. Put ~ 5g of each standard in 30ml glass beaker covered in aluminum foil. Ensure that oven is at correct temperature and then put dishes in oven at 65 \u00baC for 1 hour. 2. Remove standards from oven and put in desiccator to cool for 1/2 hour. 3. Make Primary stock solution. To a 500mL volumetric flask, add: 3.6080 g KNO 3 (in desiccator in analytical room) 2.3585 g (NH 4 )2SO 4 (in desiccator in analytical room) -> Add nanopure water to bring to 500 ml. Primary stock is approx. 1000 ppm NO3-N, NH4-N. Calculate exact ppm using the \u201cdilution-calcs_NH4-NO3.xlsx\u201d worksheet (found in CBS shared drive> LAB-shobbie > Hobbie LAB Docs> Protocols > Microplate N Protocols). Make working stock and standards 1-7 based on weight. Tare a flask, pipet the appropriate volume of stock, record the weight. Bring standards up to volume with appropriate matrix (same as samples), record final volume. Calculate exact ppm of each standard using the \u201cdilution-calcs_NH4-NO3.xlsx\u201d worksheet and record on the flask. Note P= primary stock, W= working stock. NO 2 CHECK STANDARD If you want to make an NO 2 check standard, prepare 1000ppm NO 2 primary stock (3.038 g KNO 2 \u2013 stored in desiccator in analytical room \u2013 per 500ml) and dilute to high standard concentration. Use the \u201cdilution-calcs_NH4-NO3.xlsx\u201d worksheet. NOTE Make up standards in same matrix as samples (e.g. DI water, 2M KCl, 1M K 2 SO 4 ), although the primary standard can always be made in DI water Assay Notes: this method is only appropriate for samples with little or no coloration. Samples that have high coloration (dissolved organic carbon) need to be analyzed with additional sample control well where the salicylate solution is replaced with DI water. Each NH 4 + assay well consists of: 80 \u03bcl sample or standard 60 \u03bcl salicylate solution 60 \u03bcl bleach solution -> Incubate 50min \u2013 4h. Read plate at 650 nm. -> Detection limit: 0.1 - 50 ppm Each NO 3 - assay well consists of: 100 \u03bcl sample or standard 100 \u03bcl vanadium reagent -> Incubate for 5h \u2013 20h. Read plate at 540 nm. (** see note at end about incubation times) -> Detection limit: 0.1 - 50 ppm In order to use the Biotek Precision Pippetor (henceforth sharktigator) most effectively, analysis components are separated into 3 plate types; standards plates, samples plates, and analytic plates. 1. Prepare Standards plate. This can be done a day in advance, as long as plate is covered and refrigerated. Preparation is done by hand pipetting. Using the deep well (1-ml) plates, pipet 1 ml of standards into each well (as below). One standards plate will do 192 samples. 2. Prepare Sample Plate This also can be done a day in advance, as long as plate is covered and refrigerated. Preparation is done by hand pipetting. Be sure to note where samples are located in spreadsheet. The spreadsheet can be found in CBS shared drive > LAB-shobbie > Hobbie LAB Docs> Protocols > Microplate N Protocols > Microplate-N-Data-Analysis-Template-2013-07-04.xlsx. Using the deep well (1-ml) plates, pipet 1 ml of standards into each well (as below). You will need two sample plates to assay 192 samples. Appropriate quality control checks should be included in the 192 samples. It is suggested to do one QC check every 11 samples (i.e. one every two columns on the plate reader). NOTE: Hand pipetting 1 standard plate and 2 sample plates (for 192 samples) takes approx. 3 hrs. Example of sample plate schematic (from Standard Plate 1): 3. Prepare Analytic plate Analytic plates are prepared using the robopippettor using the standards and samples plates. Example of analytic plate schematic (from Analytic Plate 1): Open the program \u201cPrecision Power V2\u201d on the desktop. Robopipettor methods are in the folder \u201c2012-PlateN-Methods folder\u201d Open \u201cDeep-well methods\u201d. Standard \u2013 Sample Pipetting : The sample pipetting methods are named in the form \u201cNA-SAMPLE-STND-2012-03-20-PLATES 1-3b.PGM\u201d. \u201cNA\u201d is nitrate-ammonium methods, \u201cN\u201d is nitrate only, and \u201cA\u201d is ammonium only. The 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12 refer to from which columns on the standard plate it will pipet from. These 4 different methods will be used sequentially with 1 standards plate and two sample plates to make 24 analytic plates (12 for each analyte). NOTE: Robo-pipetting 24 analytic plates (12 for each analyte; for 192 samples) takes approx. 1.75 hrs. Specific Steps: 1. Load method \u201c1-3b\u201d. 2. Put new box of tips in Position A. 3. Position B is empty. 4. Put standards deep well plate in position C. Note: you have to put the deep well plates into the very low black tray, and not on the elevated trays, secure the deep well plate in the black tray using pennies, place two on each side of the bottom right corner. Always place trays so that well A1 is in the upper left corner. 5. Put sample plate 1 in position D (again, not on the raised trays). 6. Put two empty clear flat-bottom microplates in positions E and F. 7. When method \u201c1-3b\u201d is loaded and tips/plates are in place, click on the drop menu for \u2018instrument\u2019 and click \u201cPrecision Series\u201d.

Hit the start button at the bottom of the screen to begin pipetting. 8. The microplate from position E is the NH 4 + analytical plate, the plate from position F is the NO 3 - analytical plate (in the \u201cNA\u201d method). Both plates are ammonium and nitrate in the \u201cA\u201d and \u201cN\u201d methods, respectively. 9. The program will pause after pipetting the first set of analytical plates. Remove and label the plates (A for ammonia and N for nitrate). Place on clean bench space uncovered while remaining analytical plates are being prepared. Replace the analytical plates with empty clear flat-bottom plates and click \u201cresume\u201d on the program. 10. After finishing the first three sets of plates, click \u201cunload program\u201d at the bottom of the screen. 11. Load method \u201c4-6b\u201d 12. Put new box of tips in Position A. 13. Put two empty clear microplates in positions E and F. 14. Run method \u201c4-6b\u201d (see steps 7-9) The microplate from position E is the NH 4 + analytical plate, F is the NO 3 - analytical plate. 15. Unload method \u201c4-6b\u201d 16. Load method \u201c7-9b\u201d 17. Put new box of tips in Position A. 18. Put sample plate 2 in position D and secure using pennies (again, not on the raised trays). 19.

Save file as \u2018NO3-YYYY-MM-DD-initials\u2019 NOTES The plate reader The BioTek microplate reader is located in the Kinkel lab: room 312 on the third floor of Christensen Hall. A key to the Kinkel lab is in the pull out drawer in the Hobbie lab to the left of the office supply drawer by the main lab computer. Sign up to use the plate reader on the BioTek plate reader Google calendar. To access the calendar, contact (Kinkel lab manager; phone 4-2253; ) or (). Note: the plate reader computer password is written underneath the computer\u2019s keyboard. How to get to 312 Christensen from the Hobbie Lab: go to the 1st floor of the Ecology building, walk to 2nd floor of Borlaug Hall (gopher way), take a right and continue to the 2nd floor of Hayes hall. Keep walking and take a left at the end of the hall, down the \u00bd flight of stairs to Christensen Hall. Take a left and go to the end of the hall to the stairs. Go up one flight of stairs to the 3rd floor of Christensen. The Kinkel lab is halfway down the hall to the left. Incubation times Selecting the appropriate incubation time for each analyte may require some trial. We have noted precipitate formation high concentrations of NO 3 beyond 5 hours of incubation when analyzing samples and standards with a 2M KCl matrix. DATA ANALYSIS Data analysis is automatically done by pasting absorbance values into the Microplate-N-Data-Analysis-Template-2013-07-04.xlsx file (found in CBS shared drive> LAB-shobbie > Hobbie LAB Docs> Protocols > Microplate N Protocols). Data analysis files using regression (2nd order polynomial) to determine concentration. A regression from all data points is used to determine an initial concentration The regression is broken into a low and a high curve. Low curve is blank to standard 3. High curve is standards 3 to 7. The initial concentration is used to determine whether the high or low curve should be used \u2013 then one of these two curves is used to determine final concentration. R 2 values are calculated. Generally values greater than 0.98 are deemed acceptable. QUALITY CONTROL Quality control standards should be run on every plate. Quality control standards include: Replicate analyses: Samples that are run repeatedly in order to check for reproducibility of analysis. Standard checks: Standards that are run on every plate in order to check standard curve errors. Outside source standards: Standards that are prepared separately, preferably from a different lab, in order to determine magnitude changes in standard curve. Also can be used to determine reproducibility and smaller scale standard curve errors. (At this time we do not have outside source standards) Nitrite standards (NO 3 method only). Used to check reduction efficiency of NO 3 - to NO 2 - .","title":"Inorganic Nitrogen Assays for N-min"},{"location":"protocols/inorganic_nitrogen_assays_in_microplates_for_netmin/#author-hobbie-lab-updated-4-july-2013-by-charlotte-riggs","text":"","title":"Author: Hobbie Lab; Updated: 4 July 2013 by Charlotte Riggs"},{"location":"protocols/inorganic_nitrogen_assays_in_microplates_for_netmin/#goal","text":"This method is designed to measure ammonium and nitrate simultaneously, although either analyte can be assayed separately.

A key to the Kinkel lab is in the pull out drawer in the Hobbie lab to the left of the office supply drawer by the main lab computer. Sign up to use the plate reader on the BioTek plate reader Google calendar. To access the calendar, contact (Kinkel lab manager; phone 4-2253; ) or (). Note: the plate reader computer password is written underneath the computer\u2019s keyboard. How to get to 312 Christensen from the Hobbie Lab: go to the 1st floor of the Ecology building, walk to 2nd floor of Borlaug Hall (gopher way), take a right and continue to the 2nd floor of Hayes hall. Keep walking and take a left at the end of the hall, down the \u00bd flight of stairs to Christensen Hall. Take a left and go to the end of the hall to the stairs. Go up one flight of stairs to the 3rd floor of Christensen. The Kinkel lab is halfway down the hall to the left. Incubation times Selecting the appropriate incubation time for each analyte may require some trial. We have noted precipitate formation high concentrations of NO 3 beyond 5 hours of incubation when analyzing samples and standards with a 2M KCl matrix. DATA ANALYSIS Data analysis is automatically done by pasting absorbance values into the Microplate-N-Data-Analysis-Template-2013-07-04.xlsx file (found in CBS shared drive> LAB-shobbie > Hobbie LAB Docs> Protocols > Microplate N Protocols). Data analysis files using regression (2nd order polynomial) to determine concentration. A regression from all data points is used to determine an initial concentration The regression is broken into a low and a high curve. Low curve is blank to standard 3. High curve is standards 3 to 7. The initial concentration is used to determine whether the high or low curve should be used \u2013 then one of these two curves is used to determine final concentration. R 2 values are calculated. Generally values greater than 0.98 are deemed acceptable. QUALITY CONTROL Quality control standards should be run on every plate. Quality control standards include: Replicate analyses: Samples that are run repeatedly in order to check for reproducibility of analysis. Standard checks: Standards that are run on every plate in order to check standard curve errors. Outside source standards: Standards that are prepared separately, preferably from a different lab, in order to determine magnitude changes in standard curve. Also can be used to determine reproducibility and smaller scale standard curve errors. (At this time we do not have outside source standards) Nitrite standards (NO 3 method only).

Detailed Steps During Warm Up Once OPEN is loaded, and while the gas analyzers are warming up, you should do these steps. 1. Air Supply - Cartridge or Buffer Volume? If you are going to be using the 6400-01 CO2 mixer, install a cartridge now, so the system can begin pressurizing. Otherwise, prepare a buffer volume (see Air Supply Considerations on page 4-50). 2. Check the Temperatures The three measured temperatures (block, air, and leaf) are together in display group h. Check to see that they read reasonable values, and are within a few degrees of each other. Position the thermocouple properly, either just above the gasket (Figure 19-23 on page 19-25) for leaf measurement (normal), or pulled down for air temperature measurement (energy balance). 3. Check the Light Source and Sensors Check to make sure that the instrument is configured for the light source that you are using. See Specifying the Source and Sensor on page 8-3. The light sensors (ParIn_\u03bcm and ParOut_\u03bcm) are both in default display group g. See that they respond as expected when the light sensors are illuminated and darkened. If you get negative ParIn_\u03bcm values, there is probably a mismatch between the real light source, and the one OPEN thinks it has. A trip to <open> <light> <source> in Config Menu | View/edit (page 8-4) will fix that. 4. Check the Pressure Sensor The pressure measurement (Prss_kPa) is shown in display group g. See that it shows reasonable, stable values. (Typical values: 100 kPa near sea level, 97 kPa at 1000 ft., 83 kPa at 5000 ft., etc., but this varies with the weather.) 5. Check the Leaf Fan Turn the leaf fan off and on (f3 level 3), and listen for sound changes in the sensor head as the fan motor stops and starts. If you do not hear a sound when the fan should be on, it could mean a blown fuse (fan or flow board), a fan jammed with debris, or other problems (see Chapter 20). Leave the fan on when you are done. 6. Is Flow Control OK? Use the flow control key (f2 level 2) to fix the flow at 1000 \u03bcmol s-1. Watch the Flow_\u03bcms (display group b) to determine the actual maximum flow. The value is typically in the 700\u2019s if a CO2 mixer is installed, or higher if not. Now test the chemical tubes for flow restrictions by changing each from full bypass to full scrub, and watching the effect on flow rate. Normally, scrubbing will drop the maximum flow by 5 or 10 \u03bcmol s-1 per tube. Larger drops may indicate that the air mufflers in the chemical tubes are getting clogged, or that a flow diversion tube is pinched shut. See Pump/Flow Problems on page 20-13 for more details. Finally, set the flow to 500 \u03bcmol s-1. Detailed Steps After Warm Up After the IRGAs have been on for about 10 minutes, continue with the following steps: 1. Check the Flow zero In New Measurements mode, monitor Flow_\u03bcms (display line b) and turn the pump off (2 f2 N) and the chamber fan off (3 f3 O for off)2. The flow should drop to within 1 or 2 \u03bcmol s-1 of zero. If it doesn\u2019t, re-zero the flow meter (Zeroing the Flow meter on page 18-23). Turn the fan back on when done. 2. Adjust the latch, and close the chamber 1) Adjust the latch so that the chamber lips are slightly apart when the chamber is closed. 2) With the chamber closed, close the adjustment knob until it starts to become snug. 3) Open the chamber, and turn the knob one or two more half turns. Now the chamber is adjusted properly for sealing when empty, or with thin leaves. Close the chamber for the next two steps. 3. Check the CO2 IRGA zero In New Measurements mode, with the mixer off (2 f3 N), and the flow set to 500 \u03bcmol s-1 (f2 F 500 enter), monitor CO2 reference and sample (display line a). Turn the soda lime on full scrub, and the desiccant on full bypass. The reference should quickly approach zero, while the sample will approach zero a bit more slowly. If they are within 5 \u03bcmol mol-1 of zero, it will be adequate. 4. Check the H2O IRGA zero Turn the desiccant to full scrub, and watch sample and reference H2O. The reference will again approach zero faster than the sample does. It will zero more slowly than the CO2 IRGA did, however, because of water sorption. Rather than wait the 10 or 20 minutes to get a really good zero, use your judgement. If after a minute or so, the reference is down to 0.2 or 0.3 mmol mol-1 and falling slowly, that\u2019s good enough. The sample will be higher than that. Clearly, if it\u2019s negative and falling after only 1 minute, it will be going too low, and re-zeroing may be in order. If the CO2 or H2O IRGAs need zeroing, refer to Setting the CO2 and H2O Zero on page 18-11. The important thing is that the reference IRGAs are reasonably well zeroed (let\u2019s say \u00b15 \u03bcmol mol-1 CO2, \u00b10.5 mmol mol-1 H2O). The first time you match (Step 10, coming up), the sample IRGAs will be taken care of, as they are adjusted to match the reference IRGAs. Important Note about CO2 and H2O Zeros: If your chemicals are not fresh, then you will do more harm than good by setting the zeros with them. The IRGA zeros are quite stable, especially in the absence of big temperature changes. Therefore, the exercise of checking zeros each day is really a diagnostic. If the indicated concentration doesn\u2019t change when it should (that is, if it doesn\u2019t drop when you start scrubbing), then something is wrong, and it\u2019s good to find that out early. 5. Mixer Calibration If you are using the 6400-01 CO2 Mixer, run the routine found in Calib Menu | CO2 Mixer | Calibrate, described in 6400-01 CO2 Mixer on page 18-25. The chamber can be open for this. Make sure that the soda lime is on full scrub. 6. Lamp Calibration If you are using the 6400-02 or -02B LED Source, or the 6400-40 LCF, run its calibration (Calib Menu|LED Source|Calibrate described on page 18-30 , or Calib Menu | LCF Source | Calibrate described on page 27-75). You will do the best calibration by having the chamber closed onto a representative (with respect to its reflectance) leaf. This isn\u2019t critical however, but the chamber should at least be closed. 7. Check Tleaf zero Unplug the leaf temperature thermocouple connector (it\u2019s purple colored), and compare the leaf and block temperatures. If they differ by more than 0.1\u00b0, then adjust the leaf temperature zero (see Zeroing the Leaf Temperature Thermocouple on page 18-24). Finally, reconnect the thermocouple, open the chamber, and verify that \u201cTleaf_\u00b0C\u201d responds when the thermocouple is warmed by touching it. 8. Set Desired Reference Values for CO2 and H2O If you are using the CO2 mixer, set it to control on reference concentration with a target of 400 \u03bcmol mol-1. Make sure that the soda lime is on full scrub. If you are not using the CO2 mixer, monitor the reference CO2 concentration. Is CO2R_uml sufficiently stable? (Over a 30 s period, it should change less than 2 \u03bcmol mol-1.) If not, use a larger buffer volume. For H2O, set the desiccant at mid-range (between scrub and bypass) for now. 9. Leaks? Set the flow rate to 200 \u03bcmol s-1. With the chamber closed and empty, exhale around the chamber gaskets, and look for any fluctuations in the sample cell CO2 concentration (CO2S_\u03bcml, display group a). If there are no leaks, the CO2S_\u03bcml value should not increase by more than 1 \u03bcmol mol-1. 10. Match the IRGAs Matching the IRGAs is easily accomplished whether the chamber is empty or not, but it\u2019s a good policy to do this once right before starting a measurement. Refer to Matching the Analyzers on page 4-33 for how to do this. Verify that the match valve is in fact working. Figure 4-2 on page 4-34 shows what to look for. You are now ready to clamp onto a leaf and begin measurements.","title":"Licor 6400 Warmup Protocol"},{"location":"protocols/licor_6400_warmup_protocol/#author-licor-inc-manual-chapter-4-please-refer-to-the-manual-for-the-fundamental-of-good-measurements-in-chapter-4-making-measurements","text":"","title":"Author: Licor, Inc.; Manual: Chapter 4 -&gt; Please refer to the manual for the fundamental of good measurements in Chapter 4: Making Measurements."},{"location":"protocols/licor_6400_warmup_protocol/#goal","text":"Checklist of things that should be done prior to making measurements with Licor 6400/6400xt.

Clearly, if it\u2019s negative and falling after only 1 minute, it will be going too low, and re-zeroing may be in order. If the CO2 or H2O IRGAs need zeroing, refer to Setting the CO2 and H2O Zero on page 18-11. The important thing is that the reference IRGAs are reasonably well zeroed (let\u2019s say \u00b15 \u03bcmol mol-1 CO2, \u00b10.5 mmol mol-1 H2O). The first time you match (Step 10, coming up), the sample IRGAs will be taken care of, as they are adjusted to match the reference IRGAs. Important Note about CO2 and H2O Zeros: If your chemicals are not fresh, then you will do more harm than good by setting the zeros with them. The IRGA zeros are quite stable, especially in the absence of big temperature changes. Therefore, the exercise of checking zeros each day is really a diagnostic. If the indicated concentration doesn\u2019t change when it should (that is, if it doesn\u2019t drop when you start scrubbing), then something is wrong, and it\u2019s good to find that out early. 5. Mixer Calibration If you are using the 6400-01 CO2 Mixer, run the routine found in Calib Menu | CO2 Mixer | Calibrate, described in 6400-01 CO2 Mixer on page 18-25. The chamber can be open for this. Make sure that the soda lime is on full scrub. 6. Lamp Calibration If you are using the 6400-02 or -02B LED Source, or the 6400-40 LCF, run its calibration (Calib Menu|LED Source|Calibrate described on page 18-30 , or Calib Menu | LCF Source | Calibrate described on page 27-75). You will do the best calibration by having the chamber closed onto a representative (with respect to its reflectance) leaf. This isn\u2019t critical however, but the chamber should at least be closed. 7. Check Tleaf zero Unplug the leaf temperature thermocouple connector (it\u2019s purple colored), and compare the leaf and block temperatures. If they differ by more than 0.1\u00b0, then adjust the leaf temperature zero (see Zeroing the Leaf Temperature Thermocouple on page 18-24). Finally, reconnect the thermocouple, open the chamber, and verify that \u201cTleaf_\u00b0C\u201d responds when the thermocouple is warmed by touching it. 8. Set Desired Reference Values for CO2 and H2O If you are using the CO2 mixer, set it to control on reference concentration with a target of 400 \u03bcmol mol-1. Make sure that the soda lime is on full scrub. If you are not using the CO2 mixer, monitor the reference CO2 concentration. Is CO2R_uml sufficiently stable? (Over a 30 s period, it should change less than 2 \u03bcmol mol-1.) If not, use a larger buffer volume. For H2O, set the desiccant at mid-range (between scrub and bypass) for now. 9. Leaks? Set the flow rate to 200 \u03bcmol s-1. With the chamber closed and empty, exhale around the chamber gaskets, and look for any fluctuations in the sample cell CO2 concentration (CO2S_\u03bcml, display group a). If there are no leaks, the CO2S_\u03bcml value should not increase by more than 1 \u03bcmol mol-1. 10. Match the IRGAs Matching the IRGAs is easily accomplished whether the chamber is empty or not, but it\u2019s a good policy to do this once right before starting a measurement. Refer to Matching the Analyzers on page 4-33 for how to do this. Verify that the match valve is in fact working. Figure 4-2 on page 4-34 shows what to look for. You are now ready to clamp onto a leaf and begin measurements.","title":"Detailed Steps After Warm Up"},{"location":"protocols/measuring_leaf_area/","text":"Author: Cavender-Bares Lab; Updated: 3 August 2009 Goal The goal of this protocol is to standardize the measurements of leaf area using scanned leaves and Image J.

Sample Preparation 1. Soils a. Preparation for grinding soil: Add 3 - \u00bc inch steel shot ammos and 1 \u2013 3/8 steel shot ammos to soil samples (if already labeled in scintillation vials and completely dried). Add o-ring to neck of scintillation vial (this will help keep the lid in place). Cover label with clear packing tape (to avoid wear-off during shaking). Also wrap clear packing tape around the lid (to avoid loosening during shaking). b. Paint shaker: Add samples to paint cans in orderly and organized manner (important to keep samples in place during shaking). Add any fillers to empty space (e.g. foam, paper). You want the paint can as filled as possible to avoid any movement from the scintillation vials. If only filling one paint can, fill the other paint can to balance out the weight. Close paint cans with lid. Tighten the paint cans to the paint shaker and shake the samples for 120 minutes. Soil samples should be super fine with no granules. Pebbles and rocks will not grind. 2. Leaf litter a. Wiley Mill is located in Sarah Hobbie\u2019s lab. Make sure you wear a mask to protect yourself from debris and ear muffs as it is loud. b. Wipe down mill with ethanol between each sample and vacuum any debris. II. Wrapping 1. Use microbalance in Sarah Hobbie\u2019s lab. Please use the \u201cMicrobalance \u2013 Hobbie Lab\u201d calendar to schedule your time. Contact Cathleen to be added to calendar. Refer to the SOP from the Seabloom/Borer lab below. Please contact Anita Krause (aporathk@umn.edu) to be trained to use the Elemental Analyzer and schedule dates to run samples. Each sample runs for ~6 minutes. Costech CN Elemental Analyzer Standard Operating Procedures Written by Costech Analytical. Revisions and additions from Anita Porath-Krause and S.G. Winikoff; Updated: November 2019 Please ask Anita Porath-Krause if you have additional questions or need clarification. Weighing Weigh out samples, standards, and bypass in a Tin capsule (Pressed 5x9mm: recommend Costech Code 41077). 1. Please provide your own tin capsules and weigh samples before using the Elemental Analyzer. 2. Recommended: dry or desiccate samples prior to weighing (after grinding). 3. For each round or set of samples, include a series of standards, blanks, and bypass samples. For best results, follow sample preparation order bolded below. For example, samples 1-4 will be bypasses, 5-6 will be blanks, 7-10 will be standards, 11-N will be samples. Please pay attention to the number of runs tallied on the display of the analyzer. Anita will replace the insert and check the water trap every 150-180 runs. Also, note that you will want to limit your samples to less than ~140 so that the proper maintenance can be performed, and results are robust. Each set of samples should contain the following: 1. Three to four bypass samples a. Two bypass chemicals available: i. Atropine \u2013 recommended use with soil. ii. Acetanilide \u2013 recommended use with plant tissue. b. Weigh to approximately 0.5mg each. c. Z-fold, flatten, and ball. 2. Prepare two blank tins a. Z-fold, flatten, and ball like the bypass. b. When run, expect a peak at the maximum of 2-3mv (not visible at normal values). c. Should not see peak \u2013 if do, assess problem. 3. Measure four standard samples a. Use same chemical as bypass chemical. b. Weigh in a gradient. i. Example: 1 - 0.5mg, 2 \u2013 1.0mg, 3 \u2013 1.5mg, 4 \u2013 2.0mg. c. Z-fold, flatten, and ball like the bypass and blanks. 4. Measure unknown samples a. Again, limit to ~140 samples. b. Weight of the unknown will vary greatly on the type of tissue. i. Soil samples \u2013 recommend between 15 and 25mg ii. Plant samples \u2013 recommend between 7 and 10mg iii. Folding tins containing plant and soil tissue can be difficult and cause breaking of tins. DO NOT USE SAMPLE IF TIN IS BROKEN. Clean up after yourself and reweigh/prepare the sample. c. Gentle, open z-fold with \u201cHershey kiss\u201d-like twist. Conform gently. Do NOT ball tightly as tearing will occur. d. Measure an unknown quantity (between 0.4 and 0.9mg) of standard. i. Z-fold, flatten, and ball like the bypass and blanks. Run Elemental Analyzer Start up Ensure Elemental Analyzer is Ready to Run 1. Bring samples to room 440-A using a 96 well plate or some other form of containment. Place samples in each of the cells on the carousel of the auto-sampler, starting with the cell with the pin. a. The first sample will fall into the auto-sampler and cannot be seen \u2013 this is sample #1. 2. If you have properly signed up for the Elemental Analyzer, it should be in \u201cWork\u201d mode and the right, left, and oven lights below the display will be green (this means the furnaces are at temperature). Additionally, the analyzer and all components will have been checked for leaks. Sloppy sample preparation and gas leaks are the two biggest contributors to poor reads. b.

Please provide your own tin capsules and weigh samples before using the Elemental Analyzer. 2. Recommended: dry or desiccate samples prior to weighing (after grinding). 3. For each round or set of samples, include a series of standards, blanks, and bypass samples. For best results, follow sample preparation order bolded below. For example, samples 1-4 will be bypasses, 5-6 will be blanks, 7-10 will be standards, 11-N will be samples. Please pay attention to the number of runs tallied on the display of the analyzer. Anita will replace the insert and check the water trap every 150-180 runs. Also, note that you will want to limit your samples to less than ~140 so that the proper maintenance can be performed, and results are robust. Each set of samples should contain the following: 1. Three to four bypass samples a. Two bypass chemicals available: i. Atropine \u2013 recommended use with soil. ii. Acetanilide \u2013 recommended use with plant tissue. b. Weigh to approximately 0.5mg each. c. Z-fold, flatten, and ball. 2. Prepare two blank tins a. Z-fold, flatten, and ball like the bypass. b. When run, expect a peak at the maximum of 2-3mv (not visible at normal values). c. Should not see peak \u2013 if do, assess problem. 3. Measure four standard samples a.

Open a new file in SVC software (Alt+F+N) i. Named plant id = \u201c####\u201d c. Take a white reference with empty leaf clip, white disc facing in (Alt+R) d. Take a white target measurement (Alt+T), if line is flat at 100%, then change suffix of data file collected to \u201c####_000WR\u201d e. Take a target measurement with leaf inside, black background behind i. Change Suffix to indicate leaf type (no suffix for green, non-symptomatic, SYM for symptomatic, S-T or S-G) f. Measure 3 healthy leaves/plant; 3 symptomatic leaves when present (up to 3 measures/symptomatic leaf) g. Note log # (number after plant ID) for each measure on datasheet 7. Take a new white reference when adjusting leaf clip height 8. Copy data folder to CBS Shared drive Detailed Steps of Measurements 1. Start up a. Insert new battery in SVC console (main body of machine) b. Extend legs at base of SVC body c. Remove forelens and insert fiber optic cable and screw hand tight d. Leaf clip preparation: i. Check that black disc has ridges running parallel to the left and right sides of the reversible plate ii. If white disc is dirty/not hydrophobic: lightly sand white disc with v. fine grit sand paper under diH2O until surface of disc is uniformly hydrophobic. Let air dry. iii. Clean glass of leaf clip (in/out) if necessary e. Check that prominent screw on side of leaf clip is loose and Insert fiber optic cable into leaf clip (look in window that cable end is at edge of fiber optic cable housing). Use screw to secure into place. f. Plug in lamp power pack to leaf clip base and screw to secure g. Turn switch at top of leaf clip to Low h.

The widest part, between midvein and leaf margin, of the adaxial (upper surface) of a fully-sun exposed leaf i. When there are no symptoms on a Control, Oak Wilt, or Drought plants: 1. Measure three (3) healthy appearing, green leaf ii. When there are symptoms: 1. In addition to the healthy green measurement: Select up to 3 (if available) typical symptomatic leaves and collect up to 3 additional measurements on each leaf a. Measure the green appearing portion of that leaf (if any) b. Measure the most symptomatic portion c. Measure the transition zone between 4. Best practices for all measurements: i. Leave lamp on whole time (or let warm up again) ii. White reference (Ref, then Target) each time move leaf clip (between plants and between leaves) iii. Avoid adjusting the angle of the leaf clip between plants (adjust the height) iv. Always measure adaxial (top) of leaf v. NIR peak reflectance (~740nm) should be at least 35%, if isn\u2019t make sure enough leaf (covering at least 1/3-1/2) in clip vi. Label white reference files with suffix WR and any bad scans with BAD vii. Clean leaf clip with KimWipes and EtOH between leaves to avoid spreading pathogens viii.

Create, remove, and update documentation is essential for any organization. This webpage was created for this aim using Mkdocs to satisfy the documentation requirements for the lab. This webpage does not replace data storage requirements (e.g., group/cavender, google drive, or local drives). However, it allows users to respond questions like: Where is the data? How the data was collected? What protocol I need to be follow? I am new here, what I need to do? Among many others \u2026 If you need to create, remove, or update documentation please follow the below guide, or ask the lab-technician for help. How to build this webpage? To build this webpage, users must install on their computer: RStudio and R . Rmarkdown and Knitr packages (e.g, install.packages(\"rmarkdown\") ). pip MkDocs (e.g., in terminal pip install mkdocs ) MkDocs material theme (e.i., in terminal pip install mkdocs-material ) git and Github account. Step 1 - Clone or update the webpage repository in your local machine. If you and someone has been working on this webpage or you recently started, it is crucial to have the updated version. If you recently started, you can clone the github repository to your local machine using RStudio following: File > New Project ... > Select Version Control > Select Git You will see a \u2018clone git repository\u2019 window, add there the following URL https://github.com/Cavender-Bares-Lab/Data-management-lab.git and chose the project path of your preference. In case you have been working on this webpage using RStudio interface, it is a good practice to check if you have an updated version. For doing so, you only need to click on the Git panel and then click on pull . Remember that you will need git credentials. This first step requires basic git skills, if you are a bit lost take a look at this guide . Step 2 - Let\u2019s get familiar with Mkdocs. In non-technical words, this webpage is composed of two elements: the structure and the documentation. The structure refers to the online appearance of the documentation, and it is controlled by mkdocs.yml file. In this file, under nav: you will see the structure of how the documentation and web sections will be displayed; their sections, tabs, and sub-tabs. The documentation refers to the .md files located in the docs folder. These files contains all the information required that will be displayed in the webpage. It is good practice to keep these files in folders under docs with names relatives to tabs and sub-tabs, just to keep the webpage in order. Now that we know these elements, let\u2019s take a look at three functions of MkDocs that we will need. In RStudio you can run these commands using the \u2018Terminal\u2019 (the tab next to \u2018Console\u2019 that we always use). mkdocs serve : this command helps you to create local address where you can see the changes in our documentation in real time. This address tend to be http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and it can opened using your browser. mkdocs build : this command helps you to build the page. An step that need to be conducted close to the end of a session. mkdocs gh-deploy : this command will deploy the update the webpage to github pages. You can type these commands in the terminal to run them. In some cases (Windows most likely), you need to type extra arguments to run them, like python -m mkdocs serve . Step 3 - Let\u2019s create a documentation file. An easy way to create a documentation file is to do create a Rmarkdown ( .Rmd ) file. For this guide, let\u2019s assume that you need to document your_new_protocol in the protocols section of the lab. You can create the .Rmd file following: File > New File > R Markdown > OK In this new file you can remove all non-essential information and keep the header document similar like: title: \"Your title for the page\" date: \"2022-01-01\" output: md_document author: \"Your name\" Please pay attention to the output: section that needs to be md_document and NOT html_document . An essentinal step for what is comming. Once you create the file and their structure, you then can type or copy/paste from world the information that you want to convey in your_new_protocol file. This file uses the writing syntax of rmarkdown ; thus it is recommend to follow basic guidelines for doing an elegant document. A quick introduction to rmarkdown is this cheat sheet . Let\u2019s assume that you finished to write your documentation! You can then save the file in the folder of interest under docs . For instance, if you wrote about a protocol, you can save your file in a path like docs/protocols/your_new_protocol.Rmd . Once you storage the file in the corresponding folder, you can Knit it. But what is this? Knit , for this context, is a process to transform the rmarkdown extension ( .Rmd ) to markdown ( .md ), the extension required for Mkdocs . You can Knit the file pressing the knit button close to save, at the top of your rmarkdown document. If everything goes write, you will see a new file docs/protocols/your_new_protocol.md . Step 4 - Let\u2019s include the documentation in the .yml structure. Step 5 - Let\u2019s build the webpage, we are almost done! Step 6 - Let\u2019s publish the webpage! Step 7 - Double check, we are done! More questions? For more instructions regarding how to build this page you could follow this blog .
