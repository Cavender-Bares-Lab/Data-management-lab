Ankom Protocol for the Hobbie Lab The Ankom Fiber Analyzer utilizes a series of extractions to determine the fiber content of a plant sample. Each of the extractions should be done in the order of NDF (Neutral Detergent Fiber), ADF (Acid Detergent Fiber), then ADL (Acid Determined Lignin). The NDF solution is just soapy water. During NDF, the fraction that is washed off contains soluble cell contents like carbohydrates, lipids, pectin, starch, soluble proteins and non-protein nitrogen. The fraction that is left in the bag contains hemicellulose, proteins bound to the cell walls, cellulose, lignin, and recalcitrant materials. ADF solution is a 1.00 Normal sulfuric acid and detergent solution. During ADF, hemicellulose and bound proteins are washed off. The fraction left behind contains cellulose, lignin, and recalcitrant materials. The ADL solution is ultra nasty 72% sulfuric acid. During ADL, cellulose is washed off leaving only lignin and recalcitrant materials. All calculations can be found in the Template spreadsheet in the Ankom Data folder on the computer in the Hobbie Lab.

Label bags with special Ankom marker or permanent Sharpie. Tare Ankom bag and record weight. Weigh out .5 g (\u00b1 0.05 g) of sample and record weight. Include a blank bag in each run (each batch of 24) for a blank bag correction. Seal the bag closed within 0.5 cm from the open edge using the heat sealer. Be sure to seal the blank bag too. Spread sample uniformly inside the filter bag by shaking and lightly flicking the bag to eliminate clumping. A maximum of 24 bags may be place in the bag suspender. All nine trays are used regardless of the number of bags being processed. Place three bags per tray and then stack trays on center post with each level rotated 120 degrees. Each tray will sit in the notches of the tray below it. The weight is placed on top of the empty 9 th tray to keep the bag suspender submerged.","title":"Ankom Fiber Analyzer"},{"location":"protocols/ankom_fiber_analyzer/#goal","text":"This protocol serves as a guide to use the Ankom Fiber Analyzer.","title":"Goal"},{"location":"protocols/ankom_fiber_analyzer/#ankom-protocol-for-the-hobbie-lab","text":"The Ankom Fiber Analyzer utilizes a series of extractions to determine the fiber content of a plant sample.
